# Whistles Styles

An extension for the [WordPress Whistles Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/whistles/), which allows styles for tabs, accordions etc. to choose from the UI.

## Description

What if you could have different styles for the same kind of whistle types by simply copying CSS and/or JS files into a custom directory? What if you could simply plug in new whistle types like portfolios, sliders, featured blocks, complex tables, grids - or even yet uninvented types of content collections, without the need of creating plugins?

This plugin also allows to incorporate existing external styles for tabs, accordions etc. by simply plugging in the HTML they need to work instead of changing all external CSS classes to fulfill the needs of the Whistles plugin's HTML.

### Features

* Automatically recognized styles, no cofiguration screen.
* "Style" attribute added to the `[whistles]` shortcode for displaying whistles.
* Plug in of new types by copying new output class definition files into a custom style directory.

## Changelog
